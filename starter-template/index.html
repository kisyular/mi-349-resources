      <h4>INGREDIENTS {Serves 4}</h4>
      <div class="ingredients">
      <ul>
        <li>3 dried Mission figs</li>
        <li>½ cup dry red wine</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons raw walnut pieces</li>
        <li>All-purpose flour 2kg</li>
        <li>1 (6 oz.) ball No-Knead Pizza Dough</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>½ small head radicchio, shredded (about ¼ cup) </li>
        <li>2 oz. Taleggio or another pungent cheese, cut into small pieces</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
      <h4>RECIPE</h4>
      <div class="directions">
      <p>
        Preheat the broiler with the rack set 5 inches from the element or flame. If you are using a cast-iron skillet or griddle pan for the pizza, set it over medium-high heat until it gets smoking hot,about 15 minutes. Transfer the skillet (turned upside down) or griddle pan to the broiler.
      </p>
      <p>
        Put figs in a small skillet set over medium heat, pour in the wine, and bring to a boil. Turn off the heat and let the figs soak for at least 30 minutes. Drain, then chop into ½ inch pieces. Toast the walnut pieces in a dry skillet over mediumhigh heat, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a plate, let cool, and then coarsely chop.
      </p>
      <p>
        To shape the dough, dust a work surface with flour and put the ball of dough on it. Sprinkle with flour and knead a few times until the dough comes together. Add more flour if necessary. Form it into an 8 inch round by pressing from the center out toward the edges, leaving a 1 inch border thicker than the rest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Open the oven doorand quickly slide out the rack with the cooking surface on it. Pick up dough and quickly transfer it to the cooking surface, being careful not to touch the surface. Drizzle 1 tablespoon of oil onto the dough, scatter the walnut pieces on top, then radicchio, then chopped figs, and then cheese. Slide rack back into oven and close door. Broil pizza until crust has puffed up around the edges, pizza has blackened in spots, and cheese has melted, 3 to 4 minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remove pizza with a wooden or metal peel or a square of cardboard, transfer it to a cutting board, and let it rest a few minutes. Drizzle remaining 1 tablespoon of oil on top, cut the pizza into quarters, transfer it to a plate, and eat.
